# MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED-DETECTION-RISK-STRATIFICATION-MODELS-FOR-ARRHYTHMIA
In this study, a novel method for the detection of irregular heartbeats, is proposed that willl help in the diagnosis of Arrhythmia. A deep learning based approach is carried out by making use of a 1D Convolutional Neural Network, that is trained on the MIT BIH Arrhythmia Database.
