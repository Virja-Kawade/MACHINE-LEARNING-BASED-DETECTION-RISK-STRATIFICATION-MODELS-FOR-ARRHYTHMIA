# MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED-DETECTION-RISK-STRATIFICATION-MODELS-FOR-ARRHYTHMIA
Worldwide, heart disease continues to be the primary cause of death, necessitating the creation of reliable predictive technologies to identify people who are at
high risk. Machine learning algorithms have recently become effective tools for predicting cardiac disease, taking use of their capacity to examine intricate patterns
within big datasets. With a focus on their methodology, performance, and clinical consequences, this in-depth review intends to evaluate the state-of-the-art in machine learning-based prediction models for heart disease risk assessment.

Arrhythmia is one such cardiovascular disease that can go undetected if not monitored continuously. In this study, a novel method for the detection of irregular
heartbeats, is proposed that willl help in the diagnosis of Arrhythmia. A deep learning based approach is carried out by making use of a 1D Convolutional Neural Network, that is trained on the MIT BIH Arrhythmia Database. In the final prediction task, heartbeat signal is classified into one of the two classes: Normal and Arrhythmia. The accuracy obtained for the 1D CNN is 0.985.
